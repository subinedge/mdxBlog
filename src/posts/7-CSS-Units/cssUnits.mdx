<div className="posts-wrapper">

In this posts, we will look into CSS Units where we will be learning when and where to use _em, px, rem and %_.

### Definition:
<br/>

CSS Units are measurement units which we will be using to denote the length or size of an element in stylesheet like _padding:”5px”_.
CSS Units can be measured in two ways:

### Absolute lengths 

pixels(px), points(pt), centimeters(cm), millimeters(mm), picas(pc), inches(in)

### Relative lengths 

percentages(%), font sizes(em & rem), viewport dimensions(vw & vh), viewport max & min (vmax & vmin)

We will first look into the Absolute measurement units with examples and will conclude on how effective or in-effective they are based on that.

Let's get started.

## <u>Absolute CSS Units</u>
<br/>

Why it's called Absolute lengths? Simple! It is independent of any element or block.It doesn't care what size it's parent are. It's good to not depend on anyone, unless you are working with a team. In web development industry we are. It is not good for use on screen, because screen sizes vary too much depending on the device used for that page. 

It can be used at the place where the output medium is known like in a wedding invitation/gift card, where you will be issuing it to your friends/relatives at only one format.
