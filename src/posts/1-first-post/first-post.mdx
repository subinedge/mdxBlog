# What to expect in my blog posts

<div style={{ marginBottom: '1rem', padding: '20px', backgroundColor: '#D2F1E4'}}>

Every Sunday - _JavaScript algorithmic challenges_

Every Wednesday - _Any Frontend topic_

</div>

I love JavaScript. So thought of sharing the knowledge and ideas somewhere in the internet that i come across, where the intricate parts of JavaScript concepts are still unanswered. For building this blog it took me around 2 weeks to develop the interface and functionality, where i used GatsbyJS as my primary static site generator with GraphQL as the query language to fetch the markdown posts.

So, in this blog I will be writing posts that talk about topics such as Vanilla JavaScript, ReactJS, GatsbyJS, GraphQL and any Frontend related topics that I take interest in. Also let you know about any tools that I may find it worth sharing.

In addition, I will be writing about some tips and perhaps tutorials that I find it useful to me in development which may and may not be useful to someone else.
