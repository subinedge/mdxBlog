## What are Progressive Web Apps
<br/>

Okay.. We will first look into, what are progressive web apps aka PWA.

Have u guys ever imagined a world where you donâ€™t need to install an app from the play store for accessing an informational or shopping website like Amazon or Flipkart ? Progressive Web Apps help you achieve this by providing a seamless, app-like experience when you open a website on a mobile device.

### Definition
<br/>

An application that is built and lives on the web which behaves similar like native mobile application. Sort of hybrid app. Looks like a mobile app which lives in the web.
As simple as that. I haven't used any jargon words in this, just easy peasy.

U would have noticed one thing in my statement that "app that is built and lives on the web". That is strange right ?
Before PWA, it is not possible to build an app in the web, rather we will be using some SDK like Flutter or React Native and what we will do is we will launch it in app store or play store. This is the normal procedure, right ?.

But not in Progressive web app era.

We can build it in the web and we can launch it in the web also at zero cost. Yes its free with no strings attached.


## Advantages of PWA over native mobile apps
<br/>

Okay. So far we got to know about what is meant by progressive web app. Atleast u would have got some idea on this.

Now let's see the features PWA is providing.

### Cost efficient
<br/>

If u r like me, like, I don't wanna waste my time trying to code the app in two different languages and launch it in two different app markets costing upto 25$ of one time fee charged by Google and 99$ per year for uploading the app into App store / iOS Store. Why we need to spend this much amount on building just one app where in an alternate world you can build it easily using PWA.
